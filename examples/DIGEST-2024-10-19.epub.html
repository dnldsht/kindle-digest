        <p>The Federal Trade Commission today announced a <a

                data-entity-substitution="canonical">final “click-to-cancel” rule</a> that will require sellers to make
            it as easy for consumers to cancel their enrollment as it was to sign up. Most of the final rule’s
            provisions will go into effect 180 days after it is published in the Federal Register.</p>
        <p>“Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,” said Commission
            Chair Lina M. Khan. “The FTC’s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody
            should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.”</p><a
            href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/negoptions-1page-oct2024-thumb-v2_0.png">
            <article>


            </article>
        </a>
        <p>The Commission’s updated rule will apply to almost all negative option programs in any media. The rule also
            will prohibit sellers from misrepresenting any material facts while using negative option marketing; require
            sellers to provide important information before obtaining consumers’ billing information and charging them;
            and require sellers to get consumers’ informed consent to the negative option features before charging them.
        </p>
        <p>The final rule announced today is part of the FTC’s ongoing review of its 1973 Negative Option Rule, which
            the agency is modernizing to combat unfair or deceptive practices related to subscriptions, memberships, and
            other recurring-payment programs in an increasingly digital economy where it’s easier than ever for
            businesses to sign up consumers for their products and services.</p>
        <p>Commission approval and publication follows the&nbsp;<a
                href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/federal-trade-commission-proposes-rule-provision-making-it-easier-consumers-click-cancel-recurring">March
                2023 announcement of a notice of proposed rulemaking</a> which resulted in more than 16,000 comments
            from consumers and federal and state government agencies, consumer groups, and trade associations.</p>
        <p>While negative option marketing programs can be convenient for&nbsp;sellers and consumers,&nbsp;the FTC
            receives thousands of complaints about negative option and recurring subscription practices each year. The
            number of complaints has been steadily increasing over the past five years and in 2024 the Commission
            received nearly 70 consumer complaints per day on average, up from 42 per day in 2021.</p>
        <p>The final rule will provide a consistent legal framework by prohibiting sellers from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>misrepresenting any material fact made while marketing goods or services with a negative option feature;
            </li>
            <li>failing to clearly and conspicuously disclose material terms prior to obtaining a consumer’s billing
                information in connection with a negative option feature;</li>
            <li>failing to obtain a consumer’s express informed consent to the negative option feature before charging
                the consumer; and</li>
            <li>failing to provide a simple mechanism to cancel the negative option feature and immediately halt
                charges.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following an evaluation of public comments, the Commission has voted to adopt a final rule with certain
            changes, most notably dropping a requirement that sellers provide annual reminders to consumers of the
            negative option feature of their subscription, and dropping a prohibition on sellers telling consumers
            seeking to cancel their subscription about plan modifications or reasons to keep to their existing agreement
            without first asking if they want to hear about them.</p>
        <p>The Commission vote approving publication of the final rule in the Federal Register was&nbsp;3-2, with
            Commissioners Melissa&nbsp;Holyoak and Andrew N.&nbsp;Ferguson voting no. Commissioner Rebecca Kelly

            <p>When people try and say that regulating stuff like this is impossible, I often think about how
                unreasonably great the regulations around “Unsubscribe” links in emails are.</p>
            <p>There really seems to be no loophole or workaround despite there being huge incentive for there to be
                one. Every time I click an “Unsubscribe” link in an email (it seems like they’re forced to say
                “Unsubscribe” and not use weasel words to hide the link) I’m either immediately unsubscribed from the
                person who sent me the email, or I’m taken to a page which seemingly MUST have a “remove me from all
                emails” option.</p>
            <p>The level of compliance (and they can’t even do malicious compliance!) with this is absurd. If these new
                rules work anything like that, they’ll be awesome. Clearly regulating behavior like this is indeed
                possible.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-1">
        <div>
            <p>Unsubscribe links are a fantastic regulation, but there <i>is</i> a workaround. I must have received at
                least a dozen emails from Brown after graduating despite unsubscribing to every email they sent.</p>
            <p>The trouble is they're endlessly creative about the lists they put you on. I'd get one email from "Alumni
                Connections" and then another from "Faculty Spotlight" and then another from "Global Outreach" and then
                another from "Event Invitations, 2023 series". I'm making those names up because I forget exactly what
                they were called, but you get the idea. I hope this was in violation of the regulation: surely you can't
                invent a new mailing list that didn't used to exist, add me to it, and require me to unsubscribe from it
                individually.</p>
            <p>They finally stopped after I sent them an angry email.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-2">
        <div>
            <p>This is illegal in Europe, since you can't add somebody to a list without their consent.</p>
            <p>As usual, I know it's trendy to say on HN the EU is killing innovation with all the regulations, and
                there is truth to that, but there is also great customer protection, which seems constantly violated in
                the US.</p>
            <p>So yes, in the US, companies can flourish, but it seems the consumers are second-class citizens compared
                to companies.</p>
            <p>That's why it's nice to have both: eventually, EU regulations leak out to the rest of the world, and the
                US innovations reach us.</p>
            <p>We pay the price by having a weaker economy, they pay the price by having less dignity in their life, but
                there is eventually balance.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-4">
        <div>
            <p>No. Regulations are required so companies produce value rather than exploits. There's no stopping the
                exploits, especially in an environment where $$$ === speech, but regulation is required for companies to
                produce value for customers.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-4">
        <div>
            <p>There are many examples of successful companies that fall into that category.</p>
            <p>Sometimes an innovation needs critical mass to work - social networks for example. LinkedIn famously got
                big by being extremely aggressive on how they mined your contacts. You'd get sued to the moon and back
                in the EU for this behaviour.</p>
            <p>LinkedIn is big now, it has established itself and no longer needs to be that aggressive. Any European
                player that tried to enter the market with a less aggressive stance had no chance - they never reached
                that critical mass.</p>

            <p>Bayer would have never invented heroin, if there had not been a market for that and there is a market for

            <p>Since the people making the innovations and regulations are different, I fear there’s no way to implement
                regulation that doesn’t lead to suboptimal results.</p>
            <p>And to be clear, when I say suboptimal results I mean misery and death in large quantities.</p>

    <div class="indent-5">
        <div>
            <p>Yes, but the innovators' incentives don't always align with the needs of the people the regulations
                should protect.</p>
            <p>Regulation are a necessary balance, otherwise the innovators become so powerful they eventually
                concentrate all the power and privilege and make weaker people pay for it.</p>
            <p>Chlorofluorocarbons were an innovation for some times, then we needed regulation to save our ozone layer.
                Industrial wouldn't have stopped using it.</p>
            <p>It's a fine line, constantly moving, an nobody will never be perfectly happy about it.</p>

            <p>&gt; We pay the price by having a weaker economy, they pay the price by having less dignity in their
                life, but there is eventually balance.</p>
            <p>It doesn't need to be black or white.</p>
            <p>A country can have decent consumer protections without e.g. a tax policy that is hostile to startups. But
                many EU countries are seemingly uninterested in the latter — presumably because there are no votes in

            <p>From reading all these messages, I'm curious if an American couldn't try sending a GDPR deletion request
                by email to some of these organisations. Sure, it only technically applies to European citizens<i>, but
                    it applies to them anywhere in the world — do they really have it on record that you're not one? And
                    of course, if they do a Home Depot style block-all-EU-ip-addresses thing they probably wouldn't
                    care. But in those cases they still break the law, they're just reasonably sure that it will never
                    be enforced against them.</i></p>
            <p><i>I would imagine the potential legal risk for some orgs would be enough to make them comply, especially
                    those with a European presence (and surely a university like Brown must have both at least one legal
                    entity and enough alumni in the EU for them to count). The worst they could do is say no.</i></p>

            <p>If I catch any of these email lists not respecting my unsubscribing, I immediately mark them as "spam".

            <p>Gmail then doesn't send them to my inbox anymore. I don't think just one person marking them as spam

            <p>I’ve looked into this a bit- I believe it’s related to the checkout page loading with a default of
                “Agrees to Marketing”.</p>
            <p>What happens- at scale and I have to believe deliberately- is the “checkout created” event with that flag
                set to true is considered as “opted-in” by the marketing automation platforms everyone uses, like
                Klayvio.</p>
            <p>Even if you immediately un-check it, un-checking doesn’t trigger an unsubscribe event, since you never
                submitted the form in the first place.</p>
            <p>And because your Shopify session is now shared across stores, your email address gets opted-into
                marketing just visiting a checkout page.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-6">
        <div>
            <p>It's up to the store owner to actually default to "agrees to marketing". I'm not sure if Shopify is to
                blame when it's the owner that used an illegitimate opt-out for that setting instead of an opt-in.</p>
            <p>And of course, follow-up mails for abandoned carts are an optional setting too.</p>

    <div class="indent-7">
        <div>
            <p>The default for “Agrees to marketing” controls if the box defaults to checked on checkout, so I do think
                if the store disabled that you wouldn’t be subscribed.</p>
            <p>My theory is it started by accident- if you get a notification that says, “this checkout, this email,
                agrees to marketing: true”, it sure reads like an opt-in, and it used to be reliable. But it’s not
                anymore, because your email is already attached to the checkout when its created.</p>
            <p>“Agrees to Marketing” pre-dates the global Shop session by years, it’s plausibly an ecosystem bug; one
                with no real motivation to solve until customers start talking (more)</p>

            <p>I’m not sure what you expect to happen?</p>
            <p>&gt; I don't send mail that gets reported as spam in the first place.</p>
            <p>I ran a newsletter where people had to opt in to receiving it. It was announce news for a video game. You
                only ended up on this list if you entered your email, clicked join list, and then clicked the link in
                the email we sent to you to confirm subscription. We had a big unsubscribe button at the very top of the
                email. We still regularly got people who hit report spam on us, presumably as a way of saying g they
                didn’t want the email anymore.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="indent-7">
        <div>
            <p>&gt; I’m not sure what you expect to happen?</p>
            <p>They're probably expecting their email provider to take that info and use it somewhere upstream of their
                own individual account. Which, as you've pointed out, does happen.</p>
            <p>Maybe they don't believe that it happens often enough or something, but the thresholds do need to be
                reasonably high since, as you pointed out, some people hit the button whether it's justified or not. If
                the threshold for email provider action was too low, you'd end up not being able to send to anyone with
                Gmail because one guy forgot he signed up to a list (or signed up and immediately reported it as spam to
                spite the sender).</p>
            <p>The person you replied to also sounds like they may be using an offline or third-party email client,
                though. There's a difference between a "Report Spam" button somewhere your email provider controls, and
                a "Mark as Spam" button in your third-party email client. I'd assume there's some kind of protocol that
                could potentially allow third-party clients to report it back to the email provider, but would also
                assume it may not be as reliable as first-party interfaces.</p>

            <p>Report spam, as a generic feature? It's an okay starting point "as-is" but useless for preventing
                malicious use and it hasn't meaningfully improved since launch.</p>
            <p>Specifically for google: allow users to block whole domains; I can already do that on my own mailserver,
                why can't I do that on Google's? Then, block mail from foreign countries -- or at least countries that I
                don't care about; I can block whole ASNs on my mailserver, why can't I on Google's? That then leaves
                only mail that I can bring legal action to.</p>
            <p>Another iteration: when you "unsubscribe", then keep a record of it, and also show the history of emails
                that you've received from them on a confirmation dialog. Show me anything interesting like purchases,
                warranties, appointments, etc. When confirmed, keep a record of it. Show me a list of _all_ of the
                things I've unsubscribed from. If email is still received, automatic report spam and block the domain.
                Oh, that means that mailing lists <i>must</i> come from the same domain that sales are made on.</p>
            <p>Another iteration: a subscription should require a confirmation. Let the email server recognize the
                confirmation, and block emails whose unsubscribe links aren't in the list of confirmations. That means
                an unsubscription link should go to the same domain that a subscription was confirmed on.</p>
            <p>That's just a few spitballed ideas. Spam reporting functionality is clearly iterable, but it hasn't
                meaningfully changed for decades. It's still primarily done through opaque "reputation" scores and
                little else.</p>
            <p>I don't want "report spam" which doesn't give me feedback and continues to let spam onto the wire to my
                client, and isn't powerful enough to use to block bad actors from trivially getting to my inbox. I don't
                want to be expected to (and trained to) click on unverified links which take me to somewhere I don't
                recognize, and could take me somewhere malicious. I expect more from the largest email provider(s) in

                talking about is something much more recent, about what Google does on the receiving side of email with
                their spam filters. That was about Google’s compliance with an order from the federal election
                commission because their spam filters had biases that act like campaign financing. Google’s solution had
                bipartisan support among the commissioners as I recall.</p>

            <p>I don't think anything I said is in conflict with what you've said, I'm pointing out one of the reasons
                the poster might still be getting spam from a mail he's reported as spam. The can spam act was more
                about senders requirements than email platform providers requirements for recieving (i.e. spam
                filtering). Yes the republicans were more affected by the spam filters but both researchers and internal
                communication indicated it wasn't because of any deliberate bias (just that republican emails were more
                likely to be like spam as far as an algorithmic interpratation goes (pure uncharitable conjecture:
                perhaps because one party was more likely to include a unsubscribe button even if it wasn't required by
                the can spam act and thus weren't reported as spam as much). Because of this they sued and google
                reportedly made more tools available or atleast publicised existing tools to both republicans and
                democrats to exclude their email campaigns from getting caught in the spam filters (tools that have also
                been made available to some of the larger more legitimate bulk email providers).</p>

                advantage of all the loopholes the Republicans made, rather than trying to take the high road.</p>

                something untoward but not when the Democrats do instead of the ones that do the opposite.</p>
            <p>Also, as a general rule politicians will carve themselves an exemption to any rules they put on everyone
                else. For example, CAN SPAM applies to <i>commercial</i> email.</p>

            <p>For Super PACs: again this is from Citizens United which was pushed by Republicans and confirmed by an

            <p>&gt; the cherry picked example of CA</p>
            <p>California <i>by itself</i> accounts for more than 10% of the electorate and it's not a cherry picked
                example, it's what generally happens when a state is under one-party control. I provided links for
                California and New York because they're the two largest blue states by population.</p>
            <p>&gt; overrepresention of Republicans</p>
            <p>That is what tends to happen in <i>ungerrymandered</i> districts because of the population distribution.
                Urban areas lean heavily for Democrats whereas suburban areas have a small Republican advantage, so if
                you draw ordinary natural district boundaries you end up with a smaller number of safe Democratic urban
                districts and a larger number of tight suburban districts that lean slightly red. To get something else
                you have to draw meandering lines that try to rope slices of the urban population into the same
                districts as the suburbs.</p>
            <p>And yet, in the last decade no party has had more seats in Congress without getting more of the vote.</p>
            <p>&gt; this is from Citizens United</p>
            <p>That was just the case that made it to the court, and it was pretty clearly correctly decided. The
                alternative is the government can prohibit you from distributing political speech because it costs money
                to do it, which would imply that they could ban all private mass media under the argument that there are
                some people who can't afford a printing press or a radio tower.</p>
            <p>Or worse, tolerate corporate mass media and prohibit anything else, which was effectively the status quo
                before and the reason you see so much criticism of Citizens United from the legacy media.</p>
            <p>Previously if you wanted to convince people of something you had to buy <i>product</i> advertising from a
                legacy media company to get enough financial leverage to pressure them to emit favorable media coverage,
                or buy them outright like with Comcast and MSNBC. Now that anyone can buy political advertising directly
                they have less need to indirectly bribe those media companies anymore and the media companies hate it.
                Meanwhile the actual effect is that you can now buy a political ad <i>without</i> having enough money to
                buy the network itself.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, many knowledgeable and intelligent people have failed to look into CU from any angle other
                than the one it is usually presented from: that is is about corporate spending on elections.</p>
            <p>Which it is, but as the GP described, it's about a lot more than that.</p>
            <p>I happen to think it was incorrectly decided - SCOTUS should have differentiated between different
                categories of corporation (using existing tax code distinctions), and prevented (at least) regular
                for-profit corporations (of any tax status) from political spending. It would have left the door open to
                not-for-profit corporations still being free to spend money on e.g. publishing a book about a candidate
                within some date of an election, which is precisely what we want not-for-profit civic organizations
                (which are, you may recall, also corporations).</p>
            <p>However, it really is "pretty clearly correct" that had SCOTUS simply ruled that "no corporation can
                &lt;X&gt;" (for various values of X), we would be an extremely different and probably much worse
                situation than we were before CU. Whether it would be worse than the one we're in post-CU is hard to
                say.</p>

                political spending.</p>
            <p>It's not obvious how that would have made any difference when a for-profit corporation could just give
                the money it wants to spend to an aligned non-profit to spend it in the same way. Unless you mean to
                prevent them from donating money to the non-profit, but then where is a non-profit supposed to derive
                funding? "All political speech can be funded only by government grants" has a pretty clear conflict of
                interest, and you would then somehow have to deal with for-profit entities that inherently engage in
                political speech like newspapers and cable news networks. Why should Comcast/MSNBC or Fox be able to
                dedicate unlimited airtime to political advocacy but not Intel or Ford?</p>

            <p>"Nationally, extreme partisan bias in congressional maps gave Republicans a net 16 to 17 seat advantage
                for most of last decade. Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania alone — the three states with the
                worst gerrymanders in the last redistricting cycle — accounted for 7 to 10 extra Republican seats in the
                House."</p>
            <p>Re: Citizens... I don't even know where to start. Read about the McCain-Feingold Act. It was in place for
                a decade when Citizens was decided and the only thing it prevented was billionaires and corporations
                spending unlimited amounts of money on electioneering. (Media companies love it: they get more spending
                on ads).</p>
            <p>Before and after McCain-Feingold media companies by law aren't allowed to refuse any political ad - in
                fact, they have to offer them a slightly _below commercial market rate_! Weirdly, though, they are
                responsible for the _factual content_ of any ad they run. Election law is really interesting.</p>

                advantage for most of last decade."</p>
            <p>The Brennan Center is a left-wing think tank. They're basically describing the thing I already mentioned
                in partisan terms:</p>
            <p>&gt; "Cracking and packing can often result in regularly shaped districts that look appealing to the eye
                but nonetheless skew heavily in favor of one party."</p>
            <p>&gt; "Because of residential segregation, it is much easier for map drawers to pack or crack communities
                of color to achieve maximum political advantage."</p>
            <p>In other words, if the geography is such that there are areas where one party is highly dominant (i.e.
                urban areas) and other areas where the other party is slightly dominant (suburbs) then if you draw
                districts in a natural way the second party gets proportionally more seats because they win a larger
                number of districts by a smaller margin. They're essentially complaining that those states <i>didn't</i>
                gerrymander the districts to favor the Democrats to offset the natural advantage of Republicans in the
                existing geographic population distribution.</p>
            <p>But Congress isn't intended to use proportional representation and gerrymandering to force the number of
                party seats to match the popular vote is just disenfranchising people in a different way by ignoring the
                effect that has on the behavior of individual representatives. For example, what they're proposing would
                be a de facto ban on majority-black districts because one district which is 60% black and votes 65% for
                Democrats and another that votes 55% for Republicans would result in fewer seats for Democrats than two
                districts that are 30% black and both vote 55% for Democrats. And both of the Democrats in the latter
                districts would have to move to the right because they'd otherwise both be at risk of a Republican
                picking off enough moderates to flip the district.</p>
            <p>&gt; It was in place for a decade when Citizens was decided and the only thing it prevented was
                billionaires and corporations spending unlimited amounts of money on electioneering.</p>
            <p>It required them to spend the money in different ways, which mostly lock out <i>smaller</i> companies,
                meanwhile conglomerates buying news networks has been a thing the whole time.</p>
            <p>&gt; (Media companies love it: they get more spending on ads).</p>
            <p>Political ads are ~1% of all ad spending and much of even that money goes to the likes of Google and
                Facebook. Meanwhile it means non-media companies that want to air a political message can do it directly
                instead of having to do so indirectly by allocating more of the other 99% of ad spending to traditional
                media companies to curry favor and provide leverage to get favorable coverage.</p>
            <p>It also dilutes the power of media companies, because the media company is not going to air coverage
                contrary to their own political interests no matter how much you run non-political ads with them,
                whereas someone who has a contrary interest can now run ads on social media.</p>
            <p>&gt; Before and after McCain-Feingold media companies by law aren't allowed to refuse any political ad
            </p>
            <p>But it prohibited most entities that wanted to run those ads from doing it.</p>
            <p>Suppose Comcast and AT&amp;T don't like network neutrality and Amazon does. So Comcast buys MSNBC and
                AT&amp;T buys CNN, gears them even more to viewers in the party that had been advocating it, but
                suppresses advocacy of the issue they're on the other side of to shut off support. Should Amazon now buy
                their own network? Is that better than letting them run Facebook ads? What if the EFF or some
                non-teracorp like Digital Ocean support network neutrality, but can't afford to buy a major network?</p>

            <p>Some of us consider ALL marketing emails to be "spam", with the sole carve out being if the user

                the "Hollywood principle": "Don't call me, I'll call you." If you call me (or email, or knock on my

                didn't used to exist, add me to it, and require me to unsubscribe from it individually.</p>
            <p>Exactly, this is the core of the problem. Thought I am grateful for the "unsubscribe" option... I am
                putridly disgusted by the humiliation of unsubscribing to something I never subscribed to in the first
                place. It's just awkward and sleazy all around. Put simply : if a name is to be added to such a list, it
                shall require the consent of said person a priori, a new consent must be made per each list, with
                blanket future consent strictly banned, and secondly mass solicitations for consent also banned.</p>
            <p>To those of you who live in California, I expect many, I would advise in these cases to invoke the CCPA
                act i.e. (a) "give me all the data you have on me" (b) "delete all the data you have on me". You need to
                ask (a) first, then given that, then ask (b). If you imply you want the data deleted, they will just
                delete it and say "oopsie we can't provide you the data", so it's important to perform this sequential
                order. If Californians did this at mass scale I would imagine there would be a lot of positive bleedover
                to other states in limiting this behavior.</p>

            <p>I'm super appreciative of what we have, but there's absolutely issues.</p>
            <p>CAN-SPAM specifies that the link must be clearly marked and suggests using CSS to do so, but the link is
                still always going to be at the bottom of the email in the smallest font used. It only matters for those
                of us who <i>know to look for it</i>; many people just have to live with the spam because they don't
                know it's easy to unsubscribe.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it's not even going to be underlined or distinguished at all (that may be a violation actually
                but I'm not going to take them to court over it).</p>
            <p>There's other dark patterns too, like certain unsubscribe pages requiring you to type/paste your email in
                to actually complete the process. That is <i>100% intentional friction</i>, like github making you type
                the name of a repo into the deletion form. It should also be illegal for unsubscribing.</p>

            <p>I don't really see putting important links in the footer as anti-pattern. For my entire internet life,

            <p>Most emails I get aren't long enough to scroll anyway. Companies generally know people aren't going to
                read more than maybe a sentence in a given email. I can get to most unsubscribe buttons without even

            <p>I've noticed that many email providers (e.g. GMail, Apple Mail) will actually show an "Unsubscribe"
                button for some emails, but not all. I wonder if it just heuristics, or there's actually some existing

            <p>Anything that tries to hide the unsubscribe link or makes it especially difficult to unsubscribe, not
                only gets unsubscribed from, but also gets marked as spam by me in Gmail. I'm guessing that not only
                does Gmail filter spam by content heuristics (dick pills, Nigerian princes, etc) but also considers the
                number of times a sender has been reported as sending spam by users. I'm putting out hope that by
                clicking that spam button, the sender gets closer to being marked as a spammer for everyone.</p>
            <p>The one great thing about email is that your email provider isn't paid for delivering spam to your inbox
                unlike the USPS. There's zero incentive for Gmail to deliver anything but legitimate emails from
                responsible senders whereas the USPS will gladly deliver presorted mail because they've been paid to do

            <p>Even now the CAN-SPAM act feels outdated -- I do like the unsubscribe button, but I would like to see
                email verification made explicitly required. That in order to start emailing you, you need to send an
                initial engagement email saying that the organization wants to start emailing you, and requiring you to
                actively opt-in to emails rather than just start sending them.</p>
            <p>This would both cut down on marketing spam as well as mistaken email addresses. Most reputable websites

            <p>Yep. The company that my 401K is managed through began sending me these stupid emails about “Tips to
                manage your wealth”, and it was marked as an email that could not be unsubscribed from because it was
                pertinent to my account. It took an angry note left on their feedback form with a threat to report them
                to get those emails to finally stop showing up. It’s disgusting. I literally can’t even tell which
                emails I need to pay attention to that are about my 401K because they mingle spam in there.</p>

    <div class="indent-1">
        <div>
            <p>I agree for the most part, but I've still had lots of problems with them. I've found unsubscribe links
                that go to domains that don't resolve, or to pages that 500 or 404. I've hit unsubscribe pages where
                tapping the unsubscribe button doesn't actually do anything. I run into one of these once every few
                weeks or so.</p>
            <p>Despite the requirement for a link in the email, of course they're going to put it at the bottom, using a
                smaller font, often with a font color that's closer to the background color. This is garbage. Instead we
                should have a standard for an email header that specifies how to unsubscribe, so that email clients can
                present <i>their own</i> unsubscribe button in a conspicuous place, and then unsubscribe the recipient
                without any extra interaction required. And if these links fail to work too many times, the email
                provider can use this as a signal to stop accepting mail from that sender entirely. (And we <i>do</i>
                have this standard header! It's called List-Unsubscribe-Post.)</p>
            <p>But this still doesn't really go far enough. I want a full ban on sending me unsolicited marketing
                emails. Signing up for an account somewhere should not mean they're allowed to send me marketing emails,
                and any checkboxes authorizing that along the way should be initially unchecked. And they shouldn't be
                able to dark-pattern me into checking them by making it look like a required consent type checkbox.</p>
            <p>Absent that, any entity that wants to market to me should have to send me an initial email confirming
                that I indeed want to receive their marketing emails. If I do not reply, that's considered lack of
                consent, and then they should not be able to try again, at all, forever.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Not being blacklisted as spam is a huge market based incentive to add unsub links.</p>
            <p>A major reason for the mass adoption is that most companies use email services because running your own
                marketing email servers are extremely difficult. And those companies don't allow you to send emails
                without one to protect their own email servers in addition to following the various laws in different
                countries. It's easier to get compliance via these larger companies, particularly when it naturally
                aligns with market incentives.</p>
            <p>Regulating a million niche SaaS sites each with an individual custom payments page may be quite a bit
                harder. But maybe stuff like Stripe will make it easier as a proxy for this regulation.</p>

            <p>Exactly! Total scumbags. The way I would frame the feeling for people who don't get it - Imagine coming
                home from a walk. Your car is gone. Someone left a note on your front door. "Hi, thanks so much for
                letting me borrow your car! Call me at this number when you want it back!". The manipulative car thief
                in this example would deny stealing - pointing out they would return the car whenever asked. So you call
                them and ask for it back, but a bit of your soul dies - to ask for it back is to play along with the
                ruse that this is what you consented to in the first place. Or at least "would definitely have consented
                to if available which you weren't". And the loss of control over consent leaves a persistent sense of
                violation, after all, someone just stole from you and then has the gall to pretend you consented, to
                your face (or front door).</p>
            <p>Perhaps the car borrower-without-permission should have owed up to being a car thief. Perhaps the
                subscribe-without-permission thieves should own up to being just spammers. The insult of it all is not
                so much from the random spam, but this manipulative pretend game where we have some spam shitelist
                LARPing as a reputed newsletter of great public interest - the gall of the spammer to make-believe that
                you subscribed.</p>
            <p>It would all be easily solved if there were civil penalties for it. I'd gladly go after anyone and

            <p>No, people should be able to email me as they would normally.</p>
            <p>I should be able to block senders, or entire domains. To use a direct example: if I decide that substack
                is shit because they subscribe people without consent (which is exactly true), then I should be able to
                block <i>all</i> things from substack and not just a single email address from the domain.</p>
            <p>If the spammer is operating within the continental US (or any other country with a reasonable court
                system), then the spammer should be legally and monetarily liable for the time and money wasted.
                Everything from the second it takes my server to receive the message, to the second it takes to transmit
                to my email client, to the multiple seconds it takes me to read the headline and/or body, and the time
                it takes to press the block button -- the energy costs, the hardware cost, the bandwidth cost, my own
                time's cost, and the cost of lost confidence in the safety of the internet (just as a thief in your home
                makes you lose confidence in the safety of your neighborhood) -- all of it should be legally and
                monetarily liable.</p>
            <p>So when that shit substack email puts on a SendGrid or Mailchimp facade, or goes through some Cloudflare
                or CloudFront or whatever CDN, those "businesses" also get blocked and sued into oblivion because
                <i>fuck any "business" that doesn't want to own the relationship with their customer, and fuck any
                    "business" whose customer is not the person they're emailing</i>.</p>
            <p>So... you want to send me an email? Cool! I hope you will agree that it's legitimate *and wanted*.
                Because if it's not then I should be able to take you, or your business, to court for wasting my time
                (and time is money) -- and win on that ground alone.</p>
            <p>tl;dr:</p>
            <p>Why do I have such a stark view on this, many might ask?</p>
            <p>Well let me put it simply: "legitimate" spam is indistinguishable from targeted phishing. So that
                "unsubscribe" link that people so proudly claim is a great solution? Clicking it <i>does not</i> improve
                the spam situation and <i>does</i> increase vulnerability to malicious actors. I'm not going to click on
                that because it doesn't go anywhere that I recognize and can verify. That "unsubscribe" link is worse
                than a real solution because it's only theatre.</p>

            <p>A smart person could think of dozens of ways around any explicit legalistic regulation intended to
                protect consumers, given an afternoon.</p>
            <p>Ultimately every regulation needs an uncaptured civil service regulator who can take offense at somebody
                trying to perform cheeky workarounds and impose disproportionate punitive measures &amp; regulatory
                adjustments when the spirit of the law is violated. If you don't have that (and we don't, in many
                areas), then you don't have effective government.</p>
            <p>This is why the Federalist Society going after Chevron deference is part of an attempt to overthrow the
                government; If the iterative regulatory loop demands a full appellate process followed by getting half
                the votes in the House, 60+ votes in the Senate, and one vote in the White House, then no regulation
                will be performed in practice. Virtually everything the FTC does is now subject to Federalist Society
                veto given sufficient time for the lawsuits to be filed &amp; processed.</p>

            <p>The Unsubscribe links are so good now because all of those newsletters use the same handful of email
                marketing services. It's pretty much impossible to run your own email marketing campaign without them,
                you'll get sent right to everyone's Gmail spam box. Because those services are so big, they'll follow
                the CAN-SPAM act. What legitimate marketer wants to pay money for a service that's going to send your
                emails to spam boxes and potentially get you in trouble with the FTC? Despite Google making it difficult
                to run your own email server and doing a bunch of other fucked up shit, the centralization of email has
                produced a few good outcomes.</p>

            <p>In the case of unsubscribe links I think it’s more about having your sending reputation destroyed by ISPs
                because they will penalize you heavily if people have to use the spam button to unsubscribe. Our company
                makes it as easy as possible and practically encourage people to unsubscribe because of this.</p>

            <p>Well, the workaround to unsubscribe is just spam. It’s hard to argue that I get effectively fewer emails
                as a result of those regulations, even though I like them. I just get effectively infinite emails.
                There’s no effective difference between 10,000 spam emails a day and 11,000. The fact that Banana
                Republic actually stops sending me email when I tell them to is nice (for me and them really) but not
                practically meaningful.</p>
            <p>To the extent that I see anything other than spam email it’s just because of spam filters not anything
                regulatory. If you don’t believe me just run an email server with no spam filter.</p>
            <p>This regulation might actually be better though because it applies to only services users have given a
                credit card to. Those services are thus 100% dependent on access to the federal banking system, which
                can easily be revoked.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it's not foolproof.</p>
            <p>During the ~20 years that my predecessor in my current job worked in it, it gradually evolved from being
                primarily a hardware position with a little software development to primarily a software position with a
                little hardware building. My moderate expertise with electronic hardware helped get me the job, but then
                I basically never had to use it in the ~15 years I've been here.</p>
            <p>I still get multiple emails from Electronic Design daily. No amount of attempting to unsubscribe stops
                them. I've blocked multiple sending email addresses; they rotate them fairly frequently.</p>
            <p>It's possible I could report them for this (I haven't researched it), but since I think my spam filter
                has missed maybe 1-2 emails in all that time, it tends not to be worth it.</p>

            <p>Uh, email unsubscribe links started out great but are now really bad unfortunately :'-( The mailers do
                all sorts of tricks to make it really difficult to ubsubscribe. Eg, you think you subscribed to one
                newsletter but they actually subscribe you to <i>many different</i> actual subscriptions with your email
                address, and give them slightly different names, like 'XYZ News', 'XYZ Updates', 'Stay in touch with
                XYZ'. Then you are forced to unsubscribe from each of these one by one, and you don't even know if you
                got them all; there could be more that they could spring on you later.</p>

            <p>&gt; I often think about how unreasonably great the regulations around “Unsubscribe” links in emails are.
            </p>
            <p>While I generally agree with your opinion, the case is that bad actors are using the unsubscribe link to
                identify real email addresses. The vast majority of people do not match what I imagine might be the
                average HN tech-savvy audience.</p>
            <p>They get an email they don't want and click on "Unsubscribe" to get rid of it. What they don't know is
                that they have been added to a database of "live" emails to be sold and reused for all sorts of purposes
                from that point forward.</p>
            <p>In other words, as is the case for many laws, they keep honest people honest. You do not control
                criminals with laws until the result of the law is that they end-up in prison (or whatever the
                appropriate punishment might be).</p>
            <p>I ran an experiment during the last presidential election (US). I used two separate throw-away emails to
                subscribe to updates from both the Republican and Democratic parties. I used these emails directly on
                the main organization pages. I also setup filters to sort all incoming emails into two separate folders.
            </p>
            <p>A year later I deleted both email accounts and the tens of thousands of messages on both folders. It was
                an interesting game of whack-a-mole. Clicking on "unsubscribe" had no real effect. Both parties passed
                this email to, it seemed, everyone except for the local school janitor. It was nothing less than insane.
                There was no effective way to make it stop. I unsubscribed from both main organizations. That did
                nothing at all.</p>
            <p>My conclusion was that, while "Unsubscribe" sounds good and looks useful, it only works with non-criminal
                organizations (sorry, I consider political parties to be at the threshold of being criminal
                organizations). It's like a lock on a door, or, to use a more provocative example, a gun. The laws

            <p>It would be great to see the FTC go against predatory subscription services like Adobe. I'm fuzzy on the
                exact details, but I think they promoted a yearly subscription that was meant to look like a monthly
                subscription, where if you cancelled early they would charge you an exorbitant cancellation fee. I'm not
                sure how these new rules affect them.</p>
            <p>One recent idea I've had is that many online subscription services should automatically pause if you stop
                using it. For example: if I go a full monthly billing cycle without watching Netflix then my
                subscription should automatically pause and allow me to resume it next time I log-in. There's a ton of
                money that gets siphoned off to parasitic companies just because people forget to cancel their
                subscriptions or because they're too busy dealing with life. It might not be viable for all companies,
                but there's definitely a lot of services where such a thing would be possible, given the huge number of
                customer analytics they collect. Maybe give people the option to disable such a pause feature if they're
                really determined to keep paying for a service. But a default where subscriptions automatically pause if
                you're not using them makes a lot of sense from a user perspective. Of course businesses would probably
                hate such a ruling because it means they can't scam as much easy money.</p>

            <p>Man, I remember when Amazon Prime first started, I signed up for the free trial to get free shipping on
                something. Of course, I forgot about it and didn’t cancel, but then I got an email from Amazon saying,
                “hey, you didn’t cancel your prime subscription but you also haven’t used it at all, so we are going to
                not charge you and cancel it for now. Here is how you easily restart your subscription if you end up
                needing it”</p>
            <p>It was such a wonderful feeling that clearly impacted me so much I remember it some 20 years later. I
                gained SO MUCH loyalty to Amazon after that, and sure enough, I restarted my prime subscription a bit
                later when I got a better job and started ordering more stuff. They made so much more money off me
                because they sacrificed those few dollars for one month of my subscription fee to show me they weren’t
                just trying to make me forget to cancel.</p>
            <p>Amazon today would never do that, of course, but man I think more companies should if they want long
                term, loyal, customers.</p>

            <p>Early Amazon was pro-customer in a way that I think most people have forgotten. Maybe that was always the
                strategy? They were losing money for years, and maybe that was investing in the company, or maybe it was
                allowing really large losses to keep customers happy, planning all along to eventually clamp down when
                people were addicted. And here we are.</p>
            <p>Their return rate is still pretty terrible, IIRC. I bet they are trying to cut that down. I still see a
                lot (and I mean a LOT) of obvious Amazon returns in the line at the UPS store, and some of them are
                quite egregious (I stood behind a lady for 5 solid minutes a couple weeks ago and she was pulling return
                after return out of a big bag). Maybe Amazon will start firing those customers.</p>

            <p>&gt; <i>Early Amazon was pro-customer in a way that I think most people have forgotten.</i></p>
            <p>I think this is why I'm still such a loyal customer, and use Amazon for so many purchases. Intellectually
                I know that Amazon does super crappy things, both to their workers and around their website and sales.
                But I've been a Prime member since it was first offered, nearly 20 years now, and I still fondly
                remember when Amazon's customer service was pretty much better than anyone else's out there. It was
                actually delightful to interact with their customer service, which was (and is) so rare.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-4">
        <div>
            <p>Interestingly, I actually still have only had great experiences with Amazon customer service. I have a
                feeling that is entirely due to how much my family continues to spend with them, though. It is pretty
                well known that their customer service response to things varies with how much your spend.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-5">
        <div>
            <p>The customer service is a margins game, and you are correct that they ratio spend to returns to track
                those margins per account.</p>
            <p>The service degradation is in terms of search no longer being useful, promoted/ad brands everywhere,
                popup 'businesses' with co-mingled inventory, fake reviews, just general lack of trust earning. Amazon
                used to be THE place to get the cheapest option too, but that is rarely the case these days.</p>

            <p>The way Amazon was "losing money" in the early years was all intense reinvestment though so they could at

                they were building for one example.</p>

            <p>Yup. This is the playbook of the Enshittification[1] process as coined by Cory Doctorow.</p>
            <p>&gt; Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make
                things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back
                all the value for themselves. Then, they die. I call this enshittification, and it is a seemingly
                inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates
                value, combined with the nature of a "two-sided market", where a platform sits between buyers and
                sellers, hold each hostage to the other, raking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes
                between them.</p>

            <p>Egregious? The policy is literally "free returns". In my experience, they could cut it down a lot by not
                constantly playing pricing games and also getting rid of their slow spiteful shipping. Like if I'm in
                the market for a type of thing, and they have one of their sale days where two or three options are all
                30% off, I'll order a few options and then decide later. Or if I'm in the middle of project I'll order
                extra parts that I merely might need so that I don't get interrupted waiting for another shipping round
                (especially if I don't currently have a "trial" of their sunk cost fallacy program). If I already have
                to do an Amazon return sometime, then taking more items is basically free. I know their system is
                wasteful as fuck, but that's on them for setting up such terrible policies. I'm certainly not going to
                validate the business model of letting companies cheat customers based on making us feel bad about how
                much they waste. (all the repeatedly damaged items from Target having no clue how how to pack items is
                another example that spelled out this larger dynamic for me. at least Target lets you keep the salvage
                much of the time)</p>

            <p>Back when people were suspicious of buying things online, Amazon used to set a percentage in the low
                double digits, of revenue they assumed would be lost to refunds.</p>
            <p>That allowed an amazing customer service experience, and immense trust: if there was an issue with your
                order that couldn’t be easily fixed, then we’re very sorry, and here’s your money back.</p>
            <p>Both that program and the incentive for it are long gone.</p>

                uses to distract or diffuse a critical attack - break a system into parts and claim the parts are
                unconnected?

            <p>This is textbook enshitification: Initially, vendors create high-quality offerings to attract users, then

                users and business customers to maximize profits for shareholders. (<a

            <p>When you subscribe there are three prices given-</p>
            <p>Monthly, Annual paid monthly, and Annual prepaid. The Annual paid monthly very clearly indicates that
                there is a fee if you cancel after 14 days. The annual paid monthly is some 33% less expensive than
                monthly, with the downside that you're committing for a year, or to pay a termination fee if you cancel
                early.</p>

            <p>This has been <i>extremely</i> clear for years. Like you have to be blind to not see a "Monthly" that
                costs much more at the top, then one called "Annual billed monthly" and not have paused to do some
                diligence.</p>
            <p>Adobe does a lot of shady stuff, but on this topic we seem to hear the most from careless, thoughtless,

            <p>&gt; I think they promoted a yearly subscription that was meant to look like a monthly subscription,
                where if you cancelled early they would charge you an exorbitant cancellation fee. I'm not sure how
                these new rules affect them.</p>
            <p>I don't think it's the same situation. What Adobe was doing was offering a yearly subscription, charged
                monthly. If you tried to cancel, it would ask for payment to either cover the rest of the sub or to
                cover the "savings" that the user had obtained by selecting an annual sub rather than a true monthly
                (can't remember what exactly it tried to charge). It was deceptive as hell, but it's probably not
                covered by this rule.</p>

            <p>Given that customers are quite used to a monthly fee is a monthly subscription model, it was disingenuous
                at best. Putting significant terms in the fine print doesn't exactly engender trust.</p>

                monthly", 33% less expensive than a monthly option right above, what possible other interpretation can
                someone have?</p>

            <p>This is not how it was presented when I signed up, 8 years ago. I am aware of the differences between

            <p>A few years ago it still had the three options (monthly, annual billed monthly and annual prepaid) but
                didn't -- at least on the first page, though it did when you confirmed your transaction -- have the
                specific notice about an early termination fee. It <i>still</i> seemed like something where any rational
                person would ask themselves "what sort of idiot would pay 33% more for `monthly' when there's this no
                downside annual paid monthly thing? Got em!", but I guess there was some argument for being bamboozled.
            </p>
            <p>But it is the way it is now for at least three+ years. People are still thinking they're beating the

            <p>Does it try to ensnare users trying to save some money now? Sure, it does. It offers some revenue

            <p>In either case, my grounds for cancelling early really had nothing to do with the year-long case.</p>
            <p>My grounds for cancelling is that the software didn't work. And I don't mean in some qualitative sense.
                The software would just crash when opening files or creating new files.</p>
            <p>Adobe never held up their end of the bargain - providing functioning software.</p>

            <p>&gt; where if you cancelled early they would charge you an exorbitant cancellation fee.</p>
            <p>I'm currently in the process of de-Adboe'ing my life because of the subscription model.</p>
            <p>It's not htat you get charged an exorbitant cancellation fee, per se. It's that, from Adobe's point of
                view, you entered into a year-long contract. And so if you want to cancel after 3 months, the only
                option they give you is to pay for the rest of the entire year upfront.</p>
            <p>This has a lot of artists really pissed off and many are saying they're finally done with Adobe.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, I think we're finally in an era where Adobe doesn't actually offer the best products anyway.
            </p>
            <p>For Photoshop I'm playing with Affinity Photo. It has a six month free trial and after playing with it
                for a couple of months I think I'm going to pay for it when the trial is up. And it's a flat fee /
                perpetual license.</p>
            <p>I've been playing around with Inkscape as a FOSS alternative to Illustrator and it's OK. I might give the
                Affinity Designer trial a go since I'm enjoying Affinity Photo.</p>
            <p>For video editing Davinci Resolve is so far ahead of Premiere that it makes me wonder why Premiere is
                still used by anyone regardless of other considerations. What's bonkers is that BlackMagic gives the
                standard version of Resolve away for free... and I have yet to find myself needing features that are in
                the paid Studio version.</p>
            <p>It has its own FX tool called Fusion built-in, so After Effects also gets replaced by Resolve.</p>
            <p>I never used Adobe Animate but am starting to get into 2D animation and really like Moho Pro. It's not
                free but it has a perpetual license and apparently the first version of this software was created for
                BeOS 30 years ago, and then got ported to Windows and Mac as AnimeStudio... so it's been around forever,
                has a cool history and is starting to get used by a lot of pro studios since it gives you 3D style
                rigging for 2D / "cutout" animation which was its killer feature for me.</p>
            <p>Anyway Adobe is one of the largest companies in the world but I suspect big changes are coming in a few
                years because I can't think of any reason to buy into Creative Cloud in current year ... like not a
                single reason. Maybe if you've got some PSD files laying around that can't be opened in alternatives
                like Affinity Photo because they take advantage of very specialized features or something then you might
                be screwed but I haven't ran into any issues opening my old PSD files in Affinity.</p>

            <p>Companies are less shy about paying for recurring licenses because it's easier for them. No need to worry
                about keeping track of a perpetual license that a former employee purchased or having too many unused
                seats for a network license. Once a year, the license admin pays the bill (and potentially updates the
                network licenses) and it's all good until next year. License payments can be billed to individual
                departments. Perpetual licenses could be considered capital assets that depreciate where as a recurring
                license is an expense. This could make a huge difference on the company books. Additionally you can't
                sell a perpetual license when you don't need it anymore but you can just stop paying for a recurring
                license.</p>

                terms of the license but I have heard of buying, selling &amp; trading software licenses (at least on an
                individual basis, it might be harder for companies to do that).</p>

            <p>Let me regale you with the story of my Adobe Subscription cancellation.</p>
            <p>I had been considering learning Illustrator and to align myself, I decided to get a little skin the game.
                I signed up for the "monthly" subscription. I downloaded Illustrator, and this screenshot was my entire
                experience:</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2Fk3cJoL01-abIYFmvReq4CuKHGHnCqSaz68EI3Tr9XLU.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D5d4bb75d2b7b5cdce639725ebd8df8403563e29e"
                    rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-prev...</a></p>
            <p>Suffice it to say, this didn't meet my expectations. I thus decided to cancel and was presented with a
                $108 cancellation fee.</p>
            <p>Boo.</p>
            <p>I hit up customer service and explained my frustration. I was told that I was going to pay that $108
                since I agreed to it. I countered that contracts required consideration and since Adobe had provided no
                consideration for my valuable cash, no contract had been perfected betwixt us. He was unwilling to see
                my point. I asked for his contact information for follow-up, which he provided. I then explained to him
                that after I hung up, I was not only NOT going to pay, but that within 60 days Adobe would cancel the
                subscription voluntarily on their side and not collect a single further dime from me.</p>
            <p>His response basically amounted to "good luck with that."</p>
            <p>So, I got a temporary prepaid credit card number with $5 on it and swapped out the CC on file with Adobe.
            </p>
            <p>I then went over to Amazon and spent that $5. Who knows on what.</p>
            <p>A month goes by, turns out $0 is insufficient for a monthly subscription payment. I get a notice that the
                balance isn't good. I get several more notices.</p>
            <p>Then I get a notice that if I don't pay, I'll lose access. At about 60 days, they cancelled the
                subscription. I took a screen shot and emailed it to the CSR's contact with my "I told you so" scrawled
                on it.</p>
            <p>I never heard back, but in my mind it was a great victory. Tickertape and swooning ladies.</p>

            <p>IIRC the trick with Adobe is to cancel on the web site, and when it says "but, but, how about this great
                upgrade?" you say yes, and then you can cancel your 'new' plan during its introductory period.</p>
            <p>Maybe they closed that loophole, but it did used to work not that long ago.</p>

            <p>Great story, but you should be careful with this method if you care about your credit. They are arguably
                within their rights to report this to the credit agencies as an unpaid debt and send it to collections,
                including the cancellation fee since they can point to the clickwrap contract that states it.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="indent-2">
        <div>
            <p>Great Story!</p>
            <p>I <i>think</i> you could also dispute the charges via your credit card company. The credit card company
                should reverse the charges.</p>

    <div class="indent-3">
        <div>
            <p>I thought he was just going to say he did a chargeback, with how the first seven paragraphs went. What he
                described was not ideal for several reasons:</p>
            <p>- Some websites won't accept prepaid cards (largely because they can be used to get around things like
                this).</p>
            <p>- Who knows if a platform's going to save your previous card info to use as a fallback?</p>
            <p>- As another reply stated, the company can send you to collections if they <i>think</i> you owe them
                money. They can also do that if you do a chargeback, theoretically. However, with a chargeback, your
                card company did some basic checking of the situation and agreed with you that something was wrong about
                the payment, so assuming you win the chargeback, you've at least had a second pair of eyes on the case,
                and you have that tiny bit of metaphorical "precedent" to use if you take the collections order to
                court-- both of which also mean they're less likely to take you to collections. If you just swap out
                your card number for one that doesn't work, that shifts some of the shadiness to your end, and it
                legally appears less like you have any grounds to stand on.</p>

    <div class="indent-4">
        <div>
            <p>If I recall, the problem was that they were refusing to cancel the subscription unless I paid the
                cancellation fee.</p>
            <p>My argument was that while I may have agreed to the cancellation fee in the fine print, they contract was
                not perfected because they never provided consideration.</p>
            <p>The software would not work on my computer.</p>
            <p>My grounds for cancelling the software wasn't that I wanted to cancel early, I was satisfied with a
                year-long subscription. My grounds for cancelling was that the software simply didn't work. It crashed
                when opening AI files are creating new files.</p>

            <p>This is a great story, but I'd like to also point out that it shows why the popular trend of only blaming
                a company's top management for that company's terrible behavior is wrong: many people have a tendency to
                want to sympathize with the lowest-level workers at a company, saying "they're only doing their jobs and
                have no say in business decisions" when interacting with customer service personnel. As you can see
                here, many (if not the vast majority) of these low-ranking foot soldiers are sociopathic assholes who
                really believe the corporate BS and are happy to do their utmost to screw over customers. It's not just
                the higher-up managers or CxOs, though they usually set the direction.</p>

            <p>&gt; One recent idea I've had is that many online subscription services should automatically pause if you
                stop using it.</p>
            <p>That seems a bit fuzzy to implement, depending on what the service actually does. It's not always
                clear-cut, like watching a show on a streaming service; for example, what if the service does things in
                the background for the user too even if they're not actively 'using' it.</p>
            <p>My compromise would be something like: if the user hasn't actively engaged with your service for X
                month(s), email/text them a reminder asking if they still want to be subscribed.</p>

            <p>The most recent incarnation of their cancel subscription page had such intentionally shitty UX that I
                thought I had cancelled, but there were more pages to click through. So I ended up paying 2 months for

            <p>Nice. I canceled a service recently and I had to "continue to cancel" and click on other such
                "confirmations" such that I think I proceeded through 7-8 pages before my subscription was actually
                canceled. Truly manipulative and obtuse. That was Spotify btw. I should have recorded the process, as it

                a click of a button. I'm not in the US though (relatively poor "global South"); sometimes it pays to get
                technology with a significant delay.</p>
            <p>One of them can also create zero-cost virtual Visa Golds in a couple of minutes. If I need to use a
                really sketchy service, I simply create a throwaway card, put a bit of cash there, pay for what I need,
                and then delete the card.</p>

            <p>Yeah Spotify removed one of my family members from my 5-person subscription (only using 3 slots) so I
                immediately cancelled my subscription and had to deal with a lot of manipulative tactics to not cancel.
                This kind of behaviour 1, shouldn't be legal and 2, shouldn't be rewarded. I have plenty of Spotify
                alternatives, so this kind of behavior ultimately signals a floundering company resorting to hacks.</p>

            <p>having to go in physically to cancel for Planet Fitness was absurd and infuriating. but it worked, i

            <p>Planet Fitness pisses me off just in that they require giving them your checking account number to sign
                up instead of accepting credit cards. The only excuse I've heard for why that's a legitimate decision is
                that "some people are rude and will cancel a credit card instead of just saying they want to cancel
                their membership." But given that Planet Fitness can immediately shut off access for that person's
                app/QR code the instant a payment gets rejected, I simply do not believe the number of cancelled credit
                cards they'd have to deal with justifies the security risk and hassle (and lock-in, like you said) that
                their solution causes.</p>
            <p>The fact that even with the Black Card (any location) membership, you still have to be tied to one "home"
                location and can only manage your plan at that one location is also predatory. I've read stories of
                people calling into Planet Fitness corporate and eventually getting a customer service rep to cancel
                their plan (when the location refused to do so remotely), so it's not a limitation of their system and
                it's not a legal restriction, it's just another way they make it difficult to cancel.</p>
            <p>I will mention, one loophole for at least getting around a bad Planet Fitness location (e.g. a manager
                pretending they're not receiving the cancellation form in the mail) is going to another location, having
                them transfer your membership there, and then cancelling with them. I've done the store-and-back thing
                for changing plans before, and the managers oftentimes don't care/are happy to help with it.</p>

            <p>My workaround to this has been to email the company telling them I want to cancel. Once I either don't
                get a reply, or get a reply saying "just call us and we'll cancel!", I dispute the next charge with
                American Express and have the email record of trying to cancel. I believe they also offer a "stop
                allowing charges by this merchant" feature that cuts off future charges.</p>

            <p>American Express is a very special card that typically comes with annual fee that is very much worth it.
                I would never book any hotels, buy plane tickets or signup in any form of membership with any other card
                because I got burnt way too many times with Visa and MC is even worse. Also that's why businesses
                typically do not like AE because how easy it is to dispute the charge.</p>
            <p>But to add - I discourage you from using chargeback as a feature to stop future charges. Most banks will
                report it to your credit bureau - you won't see it in form of points being withheld BUT it might be
                adverse for you when you try to get a loan, etc. My mother disputed way too many things (memory troubles
                at her age) and they did not renew her CC after expiration date and MasterCard told her she is not
                eligible for card with her excessive CB ratio.</p>

                years how lacking AMEX seems to be in its "investigation". It at least used to take a few days and

            <p>I use one of those banks that allows me to generate sub-accounts easily, each of which has an account

                fund it regularly via automated transfers from my main balance, or you can set it up to just
                automatically pull from your main account. Then when you're done with it, you can close that
                sub-account. It's worked very well for these sorts of subscriptions.</p>

                IANAL). Of course with this FCC ruling that could very well not be the case, but in any case always be
                wary of issuing a chargeback and thinking the matter settled if you did actually have legitimate

                I've already had to dealt with their shenanigans twice.</p>

            <p>That depends on what state you're in right? (i.e. California customers can cancel online, but Wisconsin
                ones need to talk to an agent)</p>

            <p>As a Washington resident, I tested this a while back: nope, you can cancel online AFAICT (I didn’t
                actually cancel, but the click flow indicated that it should work), and do not need to be a CA resident.

            <p>I'm in Texas and was able to cancel online. It was slightly frictional. I had first paused my
                subscription. Apparently you can't cancel if your subscription is paused, so I had to reinstate the sub
                to cancel.</p>

                quickly discovered that their users liked the idea of a busy light for the office, but didn’t like to
                update it on or off throughout the day. So after the first few days people just defaulted to leaving it
                marked as “busy”. Within a week or two their coworkers realized that the light was always on busy, so
                they started asking if they were really busy.</p>
            <p>At that point, the entire busy light idea had been defeated.</p>
            <p>This product looks more versatile. Being able to automatically tie it to meeting status or set pomodoro
                timers could make it more interesting.</p>
            <p>However, I predict the same fate: Eventually people will realize the light is busy when the person isn’t
                really busy, and then return to the old habit of interrupting to ask if they’re busy.</p>

            <p>Doing this every day is a problem.</p>
            <p>Doing it 1-2 days/week is the difference between being able to get some focus time to deliver something
                of value, and just being an internal search engine.</p>
            <p>My job has lots and lots of calls. I am happy to leave most of my calendar open. But most mornings, and
                at least one full day every 2 weeks is mine, and no, you can't have it, you're not entitled to it, it's
                important to me I have that time to actually do focus work.</p>

                done today, as it was all meetings" - means I don't work for 20-30 hours/week.</p>
            <p>The trick is balance for the role. For engineers it should be a lot more focus time, for PMs and managers
                it should be a lot more managers, but you should still be able to block out calendars for focus time if
                you need to - just not all day, every day, forever.</p>

                and isn't possible with respect to how engineers work. It's also a good idea that when engineers do tell

                computer is off.</p>
            <p>The thing is, even for consultants, they get no value from a red “Busy” gadget, but having an object on
                the table which you can punch to set on which client you’re working, would certainly be useful. More fun
                than an app, because sometimes you need physical objects.</p>

                in the foreground, based on what project I had active in Eclipse (at the time) I could give a rough

                collection of games inspired by 80s-esque computer game design. The reason why I bring this up is
                because there's a website (ufo50.net) which is actually fake and completely unrelated to the actual
                ufo50 site (50games.fun) which is designed to be SEO-bait so that it can absorb traffic from search

                website, showing a map pointing to a distant country where the phone was located, and they prompted the
                user to type in the phone's pin code in order to lock the phone or something like that.</p>

            <p>It's a beautiful site and product.</p>
            <p>However, the original inventor of the Pomodoro technique explicitly advocates a "low tech" approach - a
                mechanical kitchen timer, because he argued that the tactile and auditory elements (i.e., the turning
                moves and ticking sounds) get associated with the elements of the techniques in the human brain.</p>
            <p>It would be interesting to evaluate both variants of the approach in a scientific experiment.</p>

            <p>I think hardware that can "passively" be more useful with sensors and similar are easy wins. No reason it
                has to disrupt a timer, it just hides sensors you'd want within a device that would already be sitting
                out in your home/office.</p>

                SFPs and 2 on copper. A GPU with excellent hardware transcoding, and slotted VRAM for that local LLM
                fun. Plus an 8k projector for movie nights at the office.</p>

            <p>A version of this that would be useful for WFH or private offices is an 'on air' device that you could
                mount outside your office door, which means it's not connected to your computer and could potentially
                run on a battery for a week+ or run on usb power directly.</p>
            <p>People want to come in sometimes to access a closet, but they don't know if your in a meeting, so it
                would also need to detect if your in a meeting, and the microphone being on or off is not enough because
                people often mute themselves. Calendar access is also not enough because sometimes you start a meeting
                without a calendar thingy, and also knowing if your 'on air' with an open door can tell them if they
                have to be worried if they could be on camera if they walk by the door.</p>
            <p>It could be a very simple LED, it just needs a good agent on your desktop. Also a 'yellow light' for an
                upcoming meeting in a couple minutes (so this is where calendar access is useful) or an orange light for
                camera &amp; microphone off.</p>

                beefy enough to run some simple ML for detecting instruments being played, and I only want the timer to
                count down while the instruments are playing. I picture it looking a lot like the clock above, but with
                something like a Raspberry Pi jammed inside so it's got enough power to reliably detect "violin."</p>

            <p>Hate to burst your bubble, but as an amateur musician I fear this would backfire, or at least fail to
                result in any improvement in playing ability. Silence and time are absolutely critical to playing music.
                By analogy, measuring 'time spent drawing bow across strings' would be as useful to a violin student as
                'time spent pressing foot on accelerator' would be to a driving student!</p>
            <p>From my own experience learning to play the organ, I have improved least when I play relatively fluidly,
                practising with music well within my abilities. On the contrary, the most improvement has come when I've
                slowed down, allowed myself to count the timing, repeat sections, read the sheet music more carefully or
                even just take a break entirely. So although silence won't improve one's playing by itself, I think it's
                a natural by-product of an effective studying technique that, if at all possible, shouldn't be
                discouraged with such a timer.</p>

                lengthy silence, only playing music will advance the timer.</p>

            <p>Neat! This is very close to what I want. I am looking for a very affordable device like this to affix to
                my home office doors. I would like it to be programmable allowing me to set the status to Don't Enter

            <p>This looks great! I've considered building a simple device with an LED matrix that looks similar to this,
                but could never figure out what gives the LEDs the muted look. All of the devices mentioned here (Tidbyt
                Gen2, Lamarca, Ulanzi, even the busy.bar) have it. Is the back-pannel just an LED matrix with a custom
                acrylic in front of it? How do they ensure the light from individual LEDs doesn't bleed into its
                neighbor?</p>

    <div class="indent-2">
        <div>
            <p>I wouldn't swear to it but from mine it looks like there's a grid of light guides between the led PCB and
                the front screen to prevent any cross bleed. The front screen is translucent but not transparent (think
                heavy tinted window) acrylic which gives it the muted look.</p>
            <p>It's pretty good hardware wise, it would be hard to knock up DIY for $50 even just in BOM.</p>

                make it sound okay using its built in 8-bit DACs, or great using I²S.</p>

            <p>This is a neat idea (and good looking product), but unfortunately the issue is the people who tend to
                interrupt you in the office ignore all explicit signals in my experience. Wearing noise cancelling
                headphones is an accepted sign of “in the flow, pls don’t interrupt” yet some folks feel like it doesn’t
                apply to them. Or they’d just stand next to your desk waiting for your attention. I’m pretty jaded (and
                probably still recovering from burnout) but these types of people made work unbearable. Usually an
                executive walking up to ask for the status of something even though there are other ways they can look
                at the status of something (JIRA, standup, slack updates).</p>

    <div class="indent-1">
        <div>
            <p>I don't want to disagree with your general statement, because it's correct, but I would like to point out
                that wearing noise cancelling headphones is not a good signal of ``in the flow, pls don’t interrupt.''
                The only thing it's a good signal of is ``I'm listening to something.''</p>
            <p>Some people wear headphones simply because they want to listen to music or a podcast while they
                send/check email. Some people only put them on when they're in a meeting. And yes, some people wear them
                because they want to be left alone.</p>
            <p>There are as many reasons to wear noise cancelling headphones as there are people wearing noise
                cancelling headphones, and assuming that everyone around you should know what it means to <i>you</i> is
                as insane as walking up to someone wearing noise cancelling headphones and asking for an update.</p>

            <p>Well, someone could always say, sorry I thought those were just regular headphones. :)</p>
            <p>Anyway, my philosophy is that I'm being paid by my employer not only to do work, but to help others do
                their job as well. I WANT to be the person that my co-workers are comfortable walking up to and asking
                questions even if I am in the middle of something. (Because I'm ALWAYS in the middle of something
                anyway.) It doesn't take many interactions like this before they start to associate you with the word
                "indispensable." Which is a good for job security and peer testimonials. And of course making friends.

                if the other party is not playing. It rarely helps to keep throwing subtle hints at somebody who just
                isn't going to cooperate or respect boundaries. It's the juggernaut in human relationships, especially

                at pre-arranged times.</p>
            <p>Also, no one I collaborated with or on my team was ever the issue (except that one time at my first job
                when someone lied their way into a role, and constantly asked me to do their job). If my team member
                ever wanted to chat or distract me I had no issue.</p>
            <p>It’s the fucking CEO who hasn’t bothered to talk to you for a month and ignore every email walking up to
                your desk, literally knocking on your table to get you to take your headphones off and give them your
                attention and saying “hey, when is this new feature gonna be done” when the project management software

            <p>It's about politeness. If somebody took care to produce a sign asking to avoid interruptions, I will
                think twice whether my inquiry is both urgent and important. If it is not, I will postpone it. If it is,
                I'll beg for pardon but interrupt.</p>
            <p>But no, a context switch required for uttering a few words can absolutely topple the tower of
                concentration somebody has spent last half an hour building. Certain occupations, engineering among
                them, require ingesting a large amount of context and making sense of it before productive work can
                start. My lack of patience with a question which I could answer with 10 minutes of research (or asking
                someone else) may cost my colleague an hour of lost productivity. Being mindful of this helps everyone,

            <p>Perhaps the culture within the company / department / team is to allow interruptions in the name of

            <p>I fully accept that programming is purely a mental task. I choose to think with others and then code in

                call - because you couldn't tell when people were wearing headsets the whole time - that she taped a big
                bit of card to the top of her headset saying "ON A CALL" that she could flip up and down depending on

                read some code word for word, he’d stop by to talk about nothing. I started wearing headphones when I
                was in concentration mode and that didn’t help. Then I wrote “DO NOT DISTURB” on a post-it note, stuck
                it to my headphones, and dug in for some thought-intensive hacking. He came to my desk, pulled the note
                off the headphones I wore, and tapped me on the shoulder, laughing. “Hah, look what someone taped to

            <p>Regardless, I'm struggling to know the audience here. Is it an employee in the office? If that’s the

                about something or asking you to join another useless meeting. Your boss won’t care about your status
                simply because they won’t be collocated in the same office as you most of the time (not that they care
                about your online status anyway). For colleagues, after the first month or so, everyone will pretty much
                find the best way to approach others. If you still need a device for that, then there’s a problem in
                communication that you need a persistent device all the time. At home, you won’t need such a thing. So I
                don’t know who will find it useful; it looks gimmicky.
                What’s next, a hat that will turn a green light telling people you are approachable or in the chatting

                thick enough you don't need flaps and it'll hold the shape on its own, and if you want to hide the seams

            <p>Back in 2013ish, I installed an industrial stack light at my desk (<a
                    href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/masto/54069311973/"
                    rel="nofollow">https://www.flickr.com/photos/masto/54069311973/</a>) and informed my coworkers that
                it would save them the trouble of walking all the way across the room to talk to me if I was too busy to
                be interrupted.</p>
            <p>I am not advocating or praising this behavior; I was definitely going through my prima donna phase.</p>
            <p>Later I became very timid about talking to people because the company culture was "if I have my
                headphones on, please don't interrupt me" but everyone had headphones on all the time because the office
                was a nightmare of noise and distraction.</p>
            <p>The ubiquitous slack (or equivalent) channel has a lot of downsides, but when weighed against the
                alternatives, I think I like it the best. But I'm very conscious of the fact that not everybody's brain
                has the same attention system. I think that's one of the reasons this little device has generated so
                many strongly worded comments. It's probably neither the most rude thing ever nor the most helpful thing
                ever. What would be great for productivity and happiness would be if we could find a way not to force
                everyone to try to work under the same environmental constraints. (Aspirational: I don't know how to do

            <p>For comparison, the Ulanzi TC001 mentioned throughout this thread is 32x8, for 256 pixels.</p>

            <p>&gt; techie-flavored consumerism</p>
            <p>I didn't dare comment because it would be against the HN guidelines, but I fully agree. Once the novelty

            <p>Feels like a problem in search for a solution to me. Although I haven’t worked in an office for a while
                now, so it could be that I’m not understanding the importance in such setting (or whatever is this
                device’s target use environment) that can’t be replaced with a sticky note.</p>

            <p>I don't work in an office anymore either, but when I did (years ago), I would get constantly interrupted
                by people walking up to my desk and talking to me. I like talking to people but I also need
                uninterrupted focus time.</p>
            <p>I made something similar with a blink USB light: <a href="https://blink1.thingm.com/"
                    rel="nofollow">https://blink1.thingm.com/</a> . I had a little sign that said "when it's red, I'm
                busy". And a keyboard shortcut to toggle it from red to green (it just ran a little bash script that
                invoked the blink CLI). It was duct-taped to my monitor so you could see it from far away.</p>
            <p>It worked very well to prevent interruptions from other people walking up to my desk and chatting with
                me.</p>

            <p>I had the same issue when I was in an office and we were getting close to a deadline, so everyone was
                constantly chatting about this and that to unblock themselves. It's understandable when the rhythm of
                the office gets to that point that people want answers now, but it would get to ridiculous levels where
                you couldn't focus for 10 minutes before somebody else came by with a question.</p>
            <p>I never got to the point of having a USB light as a semaphore or anything like that, but I really wanted
                to find and hack a toy traffic light that would indicate if it was a good time to interrupt me or not.
                So yeah, it was a very real problem.</p>

            <p>This is an excellent idea. A similar approach, simpler, and cheaper solution for a non-open cube/offices
                environment is a microcontroller-controlled Andon stack with color-codes for "focusing/DND", "working",
                "away", "socialization desired", and possibly "about to leave". This makes it possible to scan statuses

            <p>I wouldn't have thought this kind of thing would be useful, but after trying a few pomodoro timers I
                ended up with one (TimeTimer Plus) that is so large that it had the unanticipated benefit of notifying
                others how long I'll be busy.</p>
            <p>However, I will say it depends a great deal on your coworkers/family as to whether they <i>care</i> that

            <p>slightly off topic but ...</p>
            <p>what I really want is a LED status display built into the top edge of my laptop screen (visible from
                opposite side too) that indicates -- when I am on a meeting / when I am muted or unmuted / when my
                camera is ON. (I should be able to turn them off when i dont need them and also have a manual override
                to turn them on as well -- so I dont HAVE to indicate my true status publicly when I dont want to -- I
                might even tie it to work only when on office/home wifi only for instance)</p>
            <p>In WFH situations this would be a life saver as other people in the house might walk into your room /
                across your laptop in view of camera / want to talk to you about random things .... If this kind of busy
                indicator is present, those people can be a bit more mindful of your immediate situation and avoid
                distrubance / embarassment.</p>

            <p>In the monitor screenshot it occured to me that you need to choose back or front. But in most open
                offices you will probably need a 360 dispaly. A circle design that scrolls might work.</p>
            <p>Also pomedero breaks are also busy. Having a break is something. Being interupted during that break is no
                better than being interuppted during the work part.</p>

            <p>I've nothing but utmost love for Flipper Devices Inc., seeing their approach to PR and as a 1000% happy
                owner of a Flipper Zero that sits unused 99.99% of the time in my backpack (and boy, am I _extremely_
                happy and relieved for the 0.01% when I need it). I would pull the trigger on this in a heartbeat if I
                had the play-cash.</p>
            <p>For those specifically with productivity challenges, it seems to be a good opportunity to remind that
                there are simple techniques people can try out (even if I find hard to discipline myself to adhere to)
                like a programmer's anecdote of one of John Carmack's methods[0].</p>
            <p>I have personally adapted that technique to buying a $20 (hour-long) sand timer and turning it to its
                side when I need to pause. Unfortunately, my challenge now is overcoming my reluctance to use it more
                often, dreading the commitment I am signing myself up for as soon as I start the timer and fear of
                failure. Alas, it appears that I allow that fear to control me (into shirking responsibility).</p>

            <p>Separate of the product itself...I have to compliment whoever designed the landing page! I'm not a
                UX/UI/page design expert, but here is what i experience:</p>
            <p>* the page loads quick - without overlays, distractions, etc. the page gets to the point, and fast</p>
            <p>* immediately i see a description of what the product is...this might sound funny, but tons of product
                sites lack this most basic thing!</p>
            <p>* In addition, the very brief video at the top shows a human hand operating the product...so i know even
                more about its functions, or at least how to interact with product</p>
            <p>* a call-to-action of "BUY" is present and impossible to miss, positioned right after/below the product
                intro/description</p>
            <p>* as i scroll down, the experience is NOT janky...its a smooth scroll down the page</p>
            <p>* scrolling down informs me more about the product, including its features, different angles of the
                physical product (to help denote the features), they even squeeze in that there are developer options -
                so i'm tipped off that its not only a consumer device, but that it can be integrated with other systems,
                expanded by devs, etc.!</p>
            <p>* they include more product photos in order to show how the product may appear and/or be used in real
                life</p>
            <p>* they even include photo and description of certain features - which serve almost as a very brief user
                guide, but again, i'm sure the intent is to show off the product's feature set</p>
            <p>There probably are other great things about this page that i have not noted here...But, again, kudos to
                the person/team who designed this! I see many teams that are really intelligent, and might have great
                products/service, but they don;'t include half the elements present here. Because while i don't have
                interest in this product, damn, this an extremely compelling experience for their product! Cheers and
                kudos to all involved!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>Agree, except the product price could be right on the buy button. Now the analytics won't tell you
                whether I clicked on the buy button with an intent to buy, or did I just want to know how much it is.

        <div>
            <p>Although i'm 50/50 on showing the price on the button, i absolutely see your point! I think for devices
                that are "known" - like, say, a pair of headphones - i suppose i might want to know the price right
                away...however, for other "unknown" devices, i'd actually like to learn more about the product, its
                features, maybe use-cases, etc...and as one other person rightly noted even the "Why" i might want/need
                the product...then again, all of this info could still be shown, and displaying the price shouldn't harm
                that...so yeah, i gues you're right: they should show the price on the button. :-)</p>

                ahead of its unveiling at MAX, and it's one of the most impressive Sneaks we've seen.</p>
            <p>Project Turntable<strong> </strong>lets users easily rotate 2D vector art in 3D, whilst ensuring it still
                look like 2D art from any new angle. And even after the rotation, the vector graphics stay true to the
                original shape, maintaining the design’s original essence.</p>

            <p>I'm making some big assumptions about Adobe's product ideation process, but: This seems like the "right"
                way to approach developing AI products: Find a user need that can't easily be solved with traditional
                methods and algorithms, decide that AI is appropriate for that thing, and then build an AI system to
                solve it.</p>
            <p>Rather than what many BigTech companies are currently doing: "Wall Street says we need to 'Use AI
                Somehow'. Let's invest in AI and Find Things To Do with AI. Later, we'll worry about somehow matching
                these things with user needs."</p>

            <p>The article says clearly there's no guarantee this feature will be released.</p>
            <p>Which I'm reading as "Demo-ready, but far from production-ready."</p>
            <p>Somewhat relevant: my experience with Photoshop's Generative Fill has been underwhelming. Sometimes it's
                wrong, often it's comically wrong. I haven't had many easy wins with it.</p>
            <p>IMO this is a company that doodles with code for its own entertainment, not a company that innovates
                robust and highly useful production-ready features for the benefit of users.</p>
            <p>So we'll see if Mr Spinny Dragon makes it to production, and is as useful as billed in the demo.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-3">
        <div>
            <p>you don't need to release to production for real value. I'm under intense pressure to scope out frothy AI
                features because just discussing them with prospects has a material impact on the costs of the sales
                funnel.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-4">
        <div>
            <p>&gt; just discussing them with prospects [...] sales funnel</p>
            <p>I'll admit I have no idea what % of Adobe licensees/subscribers are individuals and small visual/graphic
                design firms (who choose Adobe for personal reasons) compared to larger companies (news agencies,
                web-design body-shops, etc) where employees use the tools given to them despite any personal preferences
                for rivals like Procreate, etc - and the rest: students, hobbyist photographers, etc.</p>
            <p>...but none of the aforementioned market-segments seem like they'd make "AI" (whatever that means) any
                part of their purchasing-decision. Buzzwords only help sales when the audience is ignorant and/or
                impressionable; and when your audience are well-informed, seasoned (and cynical) professionals then
                buzzwords have the opposite effect and damage a company's credibility.</p>
            <p>...so I'm not sure who, exactly, Adobe is trying to message with their press-copy for Adobe Firefly
                (their "generative AI for business" product); perhaps it's just a charade meant only for their
                shareholders? I'm glad they aren't copying Microsoft and shoving AI branding where it really doesn't
                belong and compromising the user-experience (...at least not so the same extent).</p>

    <div class="indent-6">
        <div>
            <p>Yup, this. I've recently interacted with someone whose board pushed for a company-wide coding assistant
                rollout, with the explicit goal of reducing development staff, or rather costs. The developers weren't
                really asking for it, but leadership assumes that they wouldn't, if it could make them redundant.</p>
            <p>Seems like getting decisions made at that level can be extremely valuable, and at the same time lets you
                get away with building something that just seems like a useful product - because the people you're
                selling to won't use it. And furthermore, they will already go into this assuming resistance from the
                actual users, so they're unlikely to even listen to their feedback.</p>
            <p>Of course it's not a long term strategy, but it seems like a potent short term money maker.</p>

            <p>I disagree with your analysis. I think this is a novel use of AI in a commercial art product. Is there

            <p>I think you're being a bit too generous with Adobe here :-). I shared this before, but it's worth
                resharing [1]. It covers the experience of a professional artist using Adobe tools.</p>
            <p>The gist is that once a company has a captive audience with no alternatives, investors come first. Flashy
                (no pun intended :-p), cool features to impress investors become more important than the everyday user
                experience—and this feature does look super cool!</p>

            <p>I don’t think those ideas are mutually exclusive. I heavily dislike Adobe and think they’re a rotten
                company with predatory practices. I also think “AI art” can be harmful to artists and more often than
                not produces uninteresting flawed garbage at an unacceptable energy cost.</p>
            <p>Still, when I first heard of Adobe Firefly, my initial reaction was “smart business move, by exclusively
                using images they have the rights to”. Now seeing Turntable my reaction is “interesting tool which could
                be truly useful to many illustrators”.</p>
            <p>Adobe can be a bad and opportunistic company in general but still do genuinely interesting things. As
                much as they deserve the criticism, the way in which they’re using AI does seem to be thought out and
                meant to address real user needs while minimising harm to artists.¹ I see Apple’s approach with Apple
                Intelligence a bit in the same vein, starting with the user experience and working backwards to the
                technology, as it should be.²</p>
            <p>Worth noting that I fortunately have distanced myself from Adobe for many years now, so my view may be
                outdated.</p>
            <p>¹ Which I don’t believe for a second is out of the goodness of their hearts, it just makes business
                sense.</p>
            <p>² However, in that case the results seem to be subpar and I don’t think I’d use it even if I could.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-3">
        <div>
            <p>Whether they avail of it, or not, Adobe have the possibility of accessing feedback and iterating on it
                for a lot of core design markets. I have a similar view to yours, but there is a segment of the AI
                community who feel that they are disrupting Adobe as much as other companies. In most cases, these
                companies have access to the domain experience which will enable AI and it won't work the other way
                around.</p>
            <p>All of this is orthogonal to Adobe's business practices. You should expect them to operate the way they
                do given their market share and the limited number of alternatives. I personally have almost moved
                completely to Affinity products, but I expect that Adobe should be better placed to execute products and
                for Affinity to be playing catchup to some extent.</p>

            <p>That is where opinions actually diverge between pro-AI and anti-AI clusters - they look gorgeous and
                human-indistinguishable if you aren't trained with tons of images, or extremely disturbing and obvious
                if you were. It's like how CGIs and special effects from the past would look terrible today.</p>
            <p>The big genAI flamewar actually has very little do with copyright or would-be-lost jobs. It's mostly
                about quality and emotions encoded in the images(deep rage). Lots of tech inclined miss this point.</p>

            <p>I think what has happened (and I’ve been hit by this in the past, it is very annoying) is: You included
                the bit in the beginning about being generally skeptical of AI art in some forms to signal that you are
                somebody with a nuanced opinion, who believes that the thing can be bad at times. Then, you go on to
                describe that this isn’t one of those times.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this gets you some comments that want to disagree with that less specific, initial aside.
                I’m not sure if people just read the first paragraph and respond entirely based on that, without
                realizing that it is not the main point of the rest of the post. Or if they just don’t want to give up
                the ground that you did in the beginning, at all, so they knowingly ignore the rest of the post.</p>
            <p>I don’t really know what to do about this sort of thing. It seems like… generally nice to be able to
                start a post with something that says basically: look I’ve thought about this and it isn’t an uninformed
                reflexive take. But I’m trying to give up on that sort of thing. It isn’t really logically part of the
                argument, and it ends with people arguing in a direction that I’m not really interested in defending
                against in this context.</p>
            <p>But it does seem a shame, because, while it isn’t logically part of the argument, it is nice to know
                beforehand how firm somebody’s stance is.</p>

                read it and appreciated it.</p>

                shown by online drawing communities wrt AI _literally_ has nothing to do with output quality of
                generated data.</p>
            <p>This is clearly incorrect to some, not to others. This point being unclear to some, leads to those people
                assuming that the commonly observed strong negativity is generalized response to all shape and form of
                new technologies, rather than that specific emotional reaction to current generation of still somewhat
                Lovecraftian generative AI outputs.</p>
            <p>A bit like what if a non-vision super LLM was to characterize anti-genAI sentiment and create
                "techno-luddite artist" persona. But there's across-modal component to it that they don't capture, so

                I just haven't drank the right kool-aid for this space.</p>
            <p>I think another, perhaps more relevant reference could be the replacement of hand-painted cells with
                computer-generated frames for animation. It replaced one kind of artist with another. Nobody got all

                sticking with what they can guarantee from experience will get a “satisfactory” result, even if it takes
                longer and might not have as high a ceiling for how perfectly the image is altered.</p>
            <p>And that’d just people who repair flaws in images. Which I’m guessing aren’t even the majority of
                Photoshop users. Is the clone brush even in the top 5 Photoshop features by usage?</p>

            <p>There was a brief moment in time where freehand was just a better and faster drawing tool than
                illustrator (which is whats is shown here) but from there on psp, ill &amp; indesign have pretty much
                killed all competition out there.</p>
            <p>The formats they use are sigularly stupid and arcane for legacy reasons, they are all mem hogs and
                inefficient to the extreme - but nothing beats that unholy trifecta and it is used it or die.</p>
            <p>Now to get the point: generative fill is one of the absolute killer features of psp - in an instant it
                does what could take multiple hours to do previously with 5-10 sec of watching a loader.</p>

                which competitors were unlikely to be able to implement) were held back until Adobe rolled out its
                subscription pricing model --- then and only then did the _really_ good stuff start trickling out, at a
                pace to ensure that companies kept up their monthly payments.</p>

            <p>This feels extremely ungenerous to the Big Tech companies.</p>
            <p>What's wrong with trying out 100 different AI features across your product suite, and then seeing which
                ones "stick"? You figure out the 10 that users find really valuable, another 10 that will be
                super-valuable with improvement, and eventually drop the other 80.</p>
            <p><i>Especially</i> when if Microsoft tries something and Google doesn't, that suddenly gives Microsoft a
                huge lead in a particular product, and Google is left behind <i>because they didn't experiment
                    enough</i>. Because you're right -- Google investors wouldn't like that, and would be <i>totally
                    justified</i>.</p>
            <p>The fact is, it's often hard to tell which features users will find valuable in advance. And when being 6
                or 12 months late to the party can be the difference between your product maintaining its competitive
                lead vs. going the way of WordPerfect or Lotus 123 -- then the smart, rational, strategic thing to do is
                to build as many features as possible around the technology, and then see what works.</p>
            <p>I would suggest that if Adobe is being slower with rolling out AI features, it might be more because of
                their extreme monopoly position in a lot of their products, thanks to the stickiness of their file
                formats. That they simply don't need to compete as much, which is <i>bad</i>.</p>

            <p>For <i>users</i>? Almost <i>everything</i> is wrong with that.</p>
            <p>There are <i>no</i> users looking for wild churn in their user interface, <i>no</i> users crossing their
                fingers that the feature that stuck <i>for them</i> gets pruned because it didn't hit adoption targets
                overall, no users hoping for popups and nags interrupting their workflow to promote some new garbage
                that was rushed out and barely considered.</p>
            <p>Users want to know what their tool does, learn how to use it, and get back to their own business. They
                can welcome compelling new features, of course, but they generally want them to be introduced in a
                coherent way, they want to be able to rely on the feature being there for as long as their own use of
                those features persists, and they want to be able to step into and explore these new features on their
                own pace and without disturbance to their practiced workflow.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="indent-3">
        <div>
            <p>Think about the other side though -- if the tool you've learned and rely on goes out of business because
                they didn't innovate fast enough, it's a whole lot <i>worse</i> for you now that you have to learn an
                entirely new tool.</p>
            <p>And I haven't seen any "wild churn" at all -- like I said in another comment, a few informative popups
                and a magic wand icon in a toolbar? It's not exactly high on the list of disruptions. I can still
                continue to use my software the exact same way I have been -- it's not <i>replacing</i> workflows.</p>
            <p>But it's <i>way</i> worse if the product you rely on gets discontinued.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="indent-4">
        <div>
            <p>The presence or absence of some subtle new magic wand icon that shows up in the toolbar is neither making
                nor breaking anyone's business. And even if it comes to be a compelling feature in my competitor's
                product, I've got plenty of time to update my product with something comparable. At least if I've done a
                good job building something useful for my customers in the first place.</p>
            <p>Generative ML technologies <i>may</i> dramatically change a lot of our products <i>over time</i>, but
                there's no great hole they're filling and there's basically no moat besides capital requirements that
                keeps competitors from catching up with each other as features prove themselves out. They just open a
                few new doors that people will gradually explore.</p>
            <p>Anxiously spamming features simply betrays a lack of confidence in one's own product as it stands,
                directly frustrates professional users, and soaks up tons capital that almost certainly has other places
                it could be going.</p>

                generative AI features <i>ever</i> might miss where the industry is going over the next 10 or 20 years.

                was the end of Google Search, unless Google proved they could respond immediately? And Google released
                Gemini less than six months later to demonstrate that Search wasn't going to go the way of Kodak, and it
                still took people a while to calm down after that?</p>
            <p>And the AI revolution is moving a <i>lot</i> faster than the digital photography revolution. We're not
                talking about "the next 10 or 20 years". You seem to be <i>severely</i> underestimating the power of
                competition and technological progress, and the ability for it to put you out of business.</p>
            <p>You're suggesting the correct approach is "deliberate, selective product decisions as you confidently
                observe your market." What happens when your deliberation is too slow, your selectivity turns out to be
                wrong, and your confidence is ill-founded? Well, the company that was willing to experiment with a lot
                more features is more likely to build the winning features and take over the market while you were busy
                deliberating.</p>
            <p>I'm surprised to be having this conversation on HN, where the start-up ethos reigns supreme. The whole
                idea of the tech world is to try new things and fail fast, because it's better for everyone in the long

            <p>In the 2010's more mature companies explored adopting this same model, especially those that had

            <p>Back in the olden days (10 years ago), when you bought software, you could actually keep using it
                indefinitely. Doesn’t matter if the company went bankrupt, if you like using Logic Pro 7 and it works
                with your equipment you can kept using it. I know people who only recently moved off of OS 9 - they were
                using creative software for over 25 years, it did what they needed it to do so they kept using it. I
                still know at least one person who uses Office for Mac 98 to this day on an iMac G3; it’s their only
                computer, but it still works and they have backups of their important documents, so why pay money to
                switch to an unfamiliar computer, OS, software?</p>
            <p>This modern idea of “you’ll own nothing and you’ll like it” ruins that of course, but if someone bought
                CS6 they can still be using it today. If adobe went bankrupt 5 years ago they could still be legally
                using it today (they’d have to bypass the license checks if the servers go down, which might be illegal
                in the US, though). If adobe goes bankrupt tomorrow and I have a CC subscription, I can’t legally keep

            <p>Even the biggest tech companies have limited engineering bandwidth to allocate to projects. What's wrong

                don't require AI to solve, and companies are starving these problems in favor of AI experiments.</p>
            <p>It would be better to sort each potential project by ROI, or customer need, or profit, or some other
                meaningful metric, and do the highest ranked ones. Instead, we're sorting first by "does it use AI" and

            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>It's not "force-feeding". You usually get a little popup highlighting the new feature that you close and
                never see again.</p>
            <p>It's not that hard to ignore a new "magic wand" button in the toolbar or something.</p>
            <p>I personally hardly use any of the features, but neither do I feel "force-fed" in the slightest. Aside
                from the introductory popups (which are interesting), they don't get in my way at all.</p>

    <div class="indent-4">
        <div>
            <p>It's popups. It's emails. It's constant nudges towards changes in workflows. Most importantly, it's
                accelerated the slurping of data and aggressive terms of service by an order of magnitude. Sure, in
                theory everyone wanted your data before, but now everyone wants all your data all the time. They want to
                upload it to their servers. They want to train products on it. And they want to ban you from using their
                product if you don't agree.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Each of our decisions to buy or not buy a product, to use or not use a feature, influences the future
                design of our products.</p>
            <p>And thank goodness, because that's the process by which products improve. It's capitalism at work.</p>
            <p>Mature technologies don't need as much experimentation because they're mature. But whenever you get new
                technologies, yes all these new applications battle each other out in the market in a kind of
                survival-of-the-fittest. If you want to call consumers "lab rats", I guess that's your choice.</p>

                they will search for another company that treats them correctly.</p>

            <p>This is certainly a great immediately useful tool but also a relatively small ROI, both the return and

                to potentially look like a lot of useless stuff in the meantime. Also, if it wasn’t for big tech and big
                investments, there wouldn’t even be these tools / models at this level of sophistication for others to
                be using for applications like this one.</p>

            <p>Not at all - Transformer was invented by a bunch of former Google employees (while at Google), primarily
                Jakob Uszkoreit and Noam Shazeer. Of course as with anything it builds on what had gone before, but it's
                really quite a novel architecture.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-6">
        <div>
            <p>The scientific impact of the transformer paper is large, but in my opinion the novelty is vastly
                overstated. The primary novelty is adapting the (already existing) dot-product attention mechanism to be
                multi-headed. And frankly, the single-head -&gt; multi-head evolution wasn't particularly novel -- it's
                the same trick the computer vision community applied to convolutions 5 years earlier, yielding the
                widely-adopted grouped convolution. The lasting contribution of the Transformer paper is really just
                ordering the existing architectural primitives (attention layers, feedforward layers, normalization,
                residuals) in a nice, reusable block. In my opinion, the most impactful contributions in the lineage of
                modern attention-based LLMs are the introduction of dot-product attention (Bahdanau et al, 2015) and the
                first attention-based sequence-to-sequence model (Graves, 2013). Both of these are from academic labs.
            </p>
            <p>As a side note, a similar phenomenon occurred with the Adam optimizer, where the ratio of
                public/scientific attribution to novelty is disproportionately large (the Adam optimizer is very minor
                modification of the RMSProp + momentum optimization algorithm presented in the same Graves, 2013 paper
                mentioned above)</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="indent-7">
        <div>
            <p>I think the most novel part of it, and where a lot of the power comes from, is in the key based
                attention, which then operationally gives rise to the emergence of induction heads (whereby pair of
                adjacent layers coordinate to provide a powerful context lookup and copy mechanism).</p>
            <p>The reusable/stackable block is of course a key part of the design since the key insight was that
                language is as much hierarchical as sequential, and can therefore be processed in parallel (not in
                sequence) with a hierarchical stack of layers that each use the key-based lookup mechanism to access
                other tokens whether based on position or not.</p>
            <p>In any case, if you look at the seq2seq architectures than preceded it, it's hard to claim that the
                Transformer is really based-on/evolved-from any of them (especially prevailing recurrent approaches),
                notwithstanding that it obviously leveraged the concept of attention.</p>
            <p>I find the developmental history of the Transformer interesting, and wish more had been documented about
                it. It seems from interview with Uszkoreit that the idea of parallel language processing based on an
                hierarchical design using self-attention was his, but that he was personally unable to realize this idea
                in a way that beat other contemporary approaches. Noam Shazeer was the one who then took the idea and
                realized it in the the form that would eventually become the Transformer, but it seems there was some
                degree of throw the kitchen sink at it and then a later ablation process to minimize the design. What
                would be interesting to know would be an honest assessment of how much of the final design was
                inspiration and how much experimentation. It's hard to imagine that Shazeer anticipated the emergence of
                induction heads when this model was trained at sufficient scale, so the architecture does seem to at
                least partly be an a accidental discovery, and more than the next generation seq2seq model that it seems
                to have been conceived as.</p>

    <div class="indent-8">
        <div>
            <p>Key-based attention is not attributable to the Transformer paper. First paper I can find where keys,
                queries, and values are distinct matrices is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03906"
                    rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03906</a>, described at the end of section 2. The authors
                of the Transformer paper are very clear in how they describe their contribution to the attention
                formulation, writing "Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling
                factor". I think it's fair to state that multi-head is the paper's only substantial contribution to the
                design of attention mechanisms.</p>
            <p>I think you're overestimating the degree to which this type of research is motivated by big-picture,
                top-down thinking. In reality, it's a bunch of empirically-driven, in-the-weeds experiments that guide a
                very local search in a intractably large search space. I can just about guarantee the process went
                something like this:</p>
            <p>- The authors begin with an architecture similar to the current SOTA, which was a mix of recurrent layers
                and attention</p>
            <p>- The authors realize that they can replace some of the recurrent layers with attention layers, and
                performance is equal or better. It's also way faster, so they try to replace as many recurrent layers as
                possible.</p>
            <p>- They realize that if they remove all the recurrent layers, the model sucks. They're smart people and
                they quickly realize this is because the attention-only model is invariant to sequence order. They add
                positional encodings to compensate for this.</p>
            <p>- They keep iterating on the architecture design, incorporating best-practices from the computer vision
                community such as normalization and residual connections, resulting in the now-famous Transformer block.
            </p>
            <p>At no point is any stroke of genius required to get from the prior SOTA to the Transformer. It's the type
                of discovery that follows so naturally from an empirically-driven approach to research that it feels all
                but inevitable.</p>

            <p>It didn't.</p>
            <p>At least, the Transformer didn't. The abstract <i>idea</i> of a language model goes way back though
                within the field of linguistics, and people were building simplistic "N-gram" models before ever using
                neural nets, then using other types of neural net such as LSTMs and CNNs(!) before Google invented the
                Transformer (primarily with the goal of fully utilizing the parallelism available from GPUs - which
                couldn't be done with a recurrent model like LSTM).</p>

            <p>On the plus side, for Adobe, is that they have a fairly stable &amp; predictable SaaS revenue stream so
                as long as their R&amp;D and product hosting costs don't exceed their subscription base, they're ok.
                This is wildly different from -- for example -- the hyperscalers, who have to build and invest far in

                ago it could be argued that GIMP, Inkscape, and Darktable could do almost everything that Photoshop,
                Illustrator, and Lightroom could, albeit with a jankier user interface.</p>
            <p>But now none of the open source software can compete with AI generative fill, AI denoising, and now AI

            <p>With all due respect there’s never been a time when that could have legitimately been argued unless
                someone was doing relatively basic things with those apps or was a hobbyist.</p>
            <p>There’s always been a significant gap in capabilities once you looked past the surface.</p>
            <p>I find this sentiment is common among FOSS advocates who don’t actually professionally use those tools.
            </p>
            <p>I am definitely an advocate for free tools closing that gap, but I both design content professionally and
                contribute to OSS projects to close that gap. So I feel quite confident in saying that gap has always
                been large when compared to the Adobe suite.</p>

            <p>Let’s assume the open source software suite was exactly as capable and performant as Adobe’s.</p>
            <p>Unless everything is exactly the same (even the default file format) you’re still going to be better off
                with “what everyone uses” because you have to share content, and one mistake of sending a GIMP file
                instead of a PSD isn’t really worth the savings.</p>
            <p>Where the open source stuff shines is where you have 10,000 employees who need minor image editing once a
                month or less; then you can save millions by using GIMP et al.</p>

            <p>Yeah precisely. The Adobe suite is affordable if you’re actively making money off using it. It’s also why
                there’s not as much investment in competing open source projects.</p>
            <p>$80 CAD/mo for the whole suite minus the substance stuff (prices are regional). For the average
                freelancer in Canada, that’s not a consequential barrier to entry. That’s &lt;$1k for a year for
                everything.</p>
            <p>If I charge a rate of something like $40/hr, that’s two hours in a month? &lt;2% of revenue. Am I going
                to risk spending that much extra time fussing with something else for 2% more $$?</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Blender gets a lot of investment because the competition is much more expensive. CA$305/mo for

            <p>In some way, having followed the open source image generation scene for a while, it feels a little bit
                like it's opposite?</p>
            <p>Most of the ai image generation stuff I've seen from adobe feels late to party in terms of what you can
                do with open source tools. Where they do compete however is with tight integration, and I guess that's
                what matters the most to users in the end.</p>
            <p>There are plugins for gimp that let you do image generation, inpainting and other things.</p>
            <p>As far as what the post shows, it looks very much like current models that generate novel viewpoints of
                an object, but for illustrations. It might be doable to fine tune this for illustrations and simply
                vectorise the new viewpoint again. Though this will destroy any structure previously held in the object.
            </p>
            <p>All I'm saying is that we have the tech to do even more than what adobe is doing, we just haven't put it

            <p>This is a common pattern across many fields. The truly top-end companies are always running ahead of open
                source.</p>
            <p>But that doesn't mean it's a permanent situation. It just means you're looking at it from a point in time
                where the commercials got there, and open source hasn't yet. Open source will get there, and then Adobe
                will be ahead on something else.</p>
            <p>I've played a bit with "comfyui" over the past few days, a bizarre name for an AI image generation power
                tool. (And other things, but I have no experience there to know how good it is at those.) It drips with
                power. The open source world is not generally behind on raw capability. As is often the case, open
                source's deficiency for generative fill for instance is that A: it offers <i>too much</i> control, too
                many knobs (e.g., "which of several dozen models would you like to start with?"), and while that's
                awesome if you know what you're doing, it is not yet at the "circle this and click 'remove'" yet, and B:
                the motivation and firepower to integrate this all into a slick package is not there. I can definitely
                do an AI generative fill with open source software, but I'll be exporting an image into comfyui, either
                building my own generative fill program or grabbing some rando's program online who may or may not be
                using compatible models or require me to install additional bespoke functionality into comfyui, doing my
                work, and re-exporting it. The job is done, but it's much more complicated, and most people don't care
                about the other extra capabilities this workflow yields so for them it's just cost.</p>
            <p>It's a very normal pattern in the open source world. Nothing about the current situation particularly
                gives me cause to worry specially about it.</p>
            <p>To be concrete, here's a YouTube video that's to the more advanced side of what you can do in the open
                source world, which is probably still ultimately simplistic compared to what some people do: <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijqXnW_9gzc"
                    rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijqXnW_9gzc</a> That entire series is worth a look,
                and there's more it doesn't cover. You can get incredible control over these tools in the open source
                world, but it involves listening to some guy on YouTube trying to explain why you might to sometimes use
                a thing called "dpmpp_2m_sde_gpu"... not exactly normie-friendly.</p>

        <div>
            <p>I mean we've been able to do generative fill and denoising, better in open for a while, its just not as
                easy (except for video really)</p>
            <p>What Adobe does is wrap those things in an easy to use app, and then charge for it, and hopefully not
                change their licensing again to grab everyones shit again.</p>
            <p>Regarding the scheduler (dpmpp) sure adobe doesn't tell you those things, but thats because they found
                one that worked, removed the options and packaged it up with a bow, comfy and a111 and forge etc, are
                more complex because they give you EVERYTHING and let you have at it. There are frontends that wipe all
                that away but they arent successful because like the linux world, people in opensource want to be able
                to tinker with all the internals and shit, which is why opensource tends to see some groundbreaking
                optimizations, like taking the Flux model from requiring 30+gb of vram to run to running on 6gb of vram

            <p>Not yet, but I imagine soon they will. Closed source is moving to video and open source is catching up to
                static images with incredible pace. I won't be suprised if not only GIMP integrates something like a
                couple of general stable diffusion models but pirated copies of photoshop find a way to hook up a local

            <p>Ex - I can <i>absolutely</i> get exactly this same rotation feature using open toolchains, they just
                haven't been nicely consolidated into a pretty package yet.</p>
            <p>So to recreate the same thing adobe is doing here I currently have to:</p>
            <p>1. Use the 3d-pack in comfy-ui to get stack orbit camera poses for my char (see: <a
                    href="https://github.com/MrForExample/ComfyUI-3D-Pack">https://github.com/MrForExample/ComfyUI-3D-Pack</a>
                scroll down to stack orbit in the readme)</p>
            <p>2. Import those images back into the open source tool manually.</p>
            <p>Is it as convenient? Nope - it requires a lot more setup and knowledge.</p>
            <p>Is it hard to imagine this getting implemented in open source? Also nope. It's going to happen, it just

            <p>Some would say that GIMP, Inkscape, and Darktable aren't really competitive yet because they haven't had
                enough investment. If we invested in them enough, and managed them well, they could be like Blender.</p>
            <p>GIMP has been in development since 1995. Photopea was initially released in 2013, <i>has been solely
                    developed by one person</i>, and is a far-and-away better Photoshop competitor. The projects
                themselves are mismanaged. GIMP should (frankly) be abandoned and completely reset, in my opinion, as
                being a failed attempt at salvaging old code forever. Wisdom is knowing when to keep pushing - and when
                to give up.</p>

            <p>But I think to create it you would build it from a database of 3d assets that you could render from many
                angles. Probably quite similar to the way the 2d to 3d works. I don't know maybe the typical 2d to 3d
                models will work out of the box or with some kind of smoothing or parameterization. Maybe if you have a
                large database of parameterized 3d models then you combine that with rendering in 2d from different
                angles then you can basically use the existing 2d to 3d model.</p>

            <p>The video you shared very much looks deserving of the 'AI' label to me.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you mean it doesn't use some of the techniques driving the current AI boom, like LLMs or
                diffusion models.</p>

            <p>&gt;SIGGRAPH from over a decade ago has entered the chat...

            <p>A version of this was available in Photoshop for a long time, but I think the feature was deprecated and
                removed completely this year. I had used it for a few things here and there, but dedicated 3D tools were
                much better if you were working in that space.</p>

            <p>This is great -- I'm always amazed how effective classical algorithms are at doing so-called "neural
                tasks". What's strange is how few SIGGRAPH tech ever makes it out as a consumer product</p>

            <p>I am sure this is the right time for hobbysts to make your own movies, and animations.</p>
            <p>I personally started programming, in part, to make simple animations like the ones you see in Scratch,
                and it’s incredible how accessible the tools are today for anyone looking to bring their ideas to life.

            <p>one thing is you can't be lazy when drawing the initial vector like a car for example, you can't just
                draw from the top and expect it to generate a side shot after rotating. You need to draw maybe an
                isometric version first.</p>

            <p>People have been using 3D models for 2D graphics for at least a decade. 3D models rotate, by default.</p>
            <p>This demo shows generating a 3D model from a simple 2D shape. It'll fall flat on its face trying to 3D
                model anything non-trivial which begs the question - who cares?</p>
            <p>Also, you'll want to animate the 3D model - which this doesn't do, so you'll soon be back to your usual
                3D toolkit anyway.</p>

            <p>The difference is that you don't need a 3D model for this.</p>
            <p>You start with 2D vector graphics that is significantly easier to create.</p>

            <p>This is in a wholly 2D program. The input is implied to be one completely flat vector drawing, which
                Illustrator turns into a 3d model, and renders back into flat vectors at multiple rotations, with no
                further work on the part of the artist.</p>
            <p>(I say "implied" because that's all they're showing in the video presentation, there may be additional
                setup involved that they're skipping. This is inside Illustrator though, which has a long history of 3d
                extensions being very awkwardly shoved into a corner of its toolset.)</p>
